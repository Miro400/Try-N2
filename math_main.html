		<h1>MATH HOMEPAGE</h1>
		<h2>Why Math is so useful?</h2>
		<p>Math is called the "Queen of sciences". Why? Because all things, that you can imagine, exist only in your head, and could be explained in Math terms. The whole human (and not only) world is built on Math calculations. Math is truly the science of God.</p>
